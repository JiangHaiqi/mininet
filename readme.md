Here is some useful and detailed scripts I have written. I am a Postgraduate student in Huazhong University of Science and Technology. I do not consider myself as a programmer. Because of the orientation in my subject, I have to learn the Software Defined Network(SDN), RYU(the controller of SDN) and the Python. Therefore, I hope this project in the github can record my learning process and progress. In the github, I will establish four projects, they are mininet, Ryu, python and APP-SDN. This project is mininet which is aimed at create the SDN network based on the OpenOflow13 and Open Vswitch.

I would gladly accept pointers from others to improve the code and make it more efficient, or simplify the code. If you would like to make any comments then please feel free to email me at jianghaiqi@hust.edu.cn.
